`(1)` Submit your request in <#{get;_bankingChannel}>. Your request **must** include rather or not you want to deposit/withdraw, as well as the tier of arts.
  
`(2)` Once your request has been seen by a {rolemention;464940319587172363} Staff, you will recieve a <:Accepted:465864690988482560> reaction & will be contacted by a Banker when they are ready.
  
`(3)` Some big orders that may take time to complete will recieve a <:Ongoing:465865079879892996> reaction until all of the arts have been moved. 
  
`(4)` Once all of the arts have been moved, a {rolemention;464940319587172363} will mark the transaction on the [Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F4W1mU2l2pYJTi2GbO8GwQjzxwKPzsax6ugWZZdqDRM/edit#gid=365362759), once that is done you will recieve a <:Completed:465864934971146240> reaction.
