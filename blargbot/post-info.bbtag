{embedbuild;color:#E2A9F3;fields.name:What is the Black Star Order?;fields.value:
The **Black Star Order** is a **Hades’ Star** community that spans multiple corporations but cooperates as one large unit. The aim of this community is to sustainably optimise the cooperative gaming experience for all of its members.

Single corporations are limited to 25 players, which unfortunately leaves them susceptible to supporting many red star levels (making it hard to organise cooperative play), varying play styles (causing a conflict of interest), and inactives (undermining the experience for every other active player).
;fields.name:What is the Black Star Order? [Mission];fields.value:
We seek to achieve our aim by managing and supporting multiple corporations as one, large, fluid ‘megacorporation’ that is divided into corps by red star levels, white star involvement, and play styles. This allows us to cater to a wider range of players, as well as accommodate those players who may change their desired level involvement with the game.
;fields.name:What is the Black Star Order? [History];fields.value:
*The Black Star Order was created by the remaining active members of a number of semi-dead corps seeking to improve their own gameplay experiences. This resulted in one merger, then two, and so on until we grew into eight corps comprised of many more original corps. While we love growing our family, note that maintaining our commitments to existing members takes priority, so we may not be able to field all requests to join right away!*

<#{get;_rsChannel}>: Join our 100 members in running RS with us in our Corps, You would be allowed to hop over to do a RS then return to your Corp afterwards. *(We do NOT do Public RS)*
<#{get;_tradeChannel}>: Trade arts with us, we will treat you like family & try to help you as much as we can: we ask for the same in return.
<#{get;_shameChannel}>: Just for those **Oops** moments in HS we come across that *hopefully* we can laugh about now.

If you have been on good terms with us, and would like to be a bigger part of our community as an {rolemention;{get;_allyRole}}, ask a {rolemention;{get;_coordRole}} in <#{get;_loungeChannel}> to become an {rolemention;{get;_allyRole}}. }}
{send;{get;~chan};{embedbuild;color:#A9F5A9;fields.name:How do I/we join the Order?;fields.value:Soon after joining this Discord a {rolemention;{get;_coordRole}} should be along to greet you in <#{get;_loungeChannel}> and begin talking shop right away. You can also directly apply in-game too, though please note that all formal communications are done via Discord.

If you are a single applicant, and we have room in a corp, then joining up is usually pretty quick and easy. If you are moving as a group, or our corps are already pretty full, then it might take us a bit longer as we figure out the best compromise for everyone.

While we love getting *new* members, our *current* members obviously take priority. Integrating your group may take a little while, and we may need to split you up across different corps. If this does happen, be assured that it is to maximise your gaming experience, and that you are always only a channel away from your buddies! Players also move between corps fairly regularly, and everyone we *do* keep on roster are friendly and active!
